  <p><strong>about good </strong>- one of the lowest grades in most grading standard books.   Typically  an about good coin is a very worn coin with some outline of the design and a readable date.  Falls below   below the grade of good.   Sometimes abbreviated as AG.</p>
  <p><strong>About Uncirculated </strong>-  Same as &quot;Almost Uncirculated&quot;.  Sometimes    abbreviated as &quot;AU&quot;. </p>
  <p><strong>abrasion </strong>- marks or small scratches on the surface of a coin where another  coin or object has slid across or bumped the coin.  Can also be caused by the coin sliding in a holder or coin drawer.  Not as deep or noticeable as bag marks.  Usually found on the high parts of a coin or in the open fields (background).   Sometimes the terms scuffing, light rubbing, or hairlines are also used to   indicate light abrasive wear. </p>
  <p><strong>accumulation </strong>- A group of coins, sometimes not of any certain type or date.  Also can be a &quot;hoard&quot;. 
  </p>
  <p><strong>Ag </strong>- elemental abbreviation for SILVER </p>

  <p><strong>Album, or coin album </strong>-  Coin albums resemble a book,   with holes or openings for displaying coins on each page.  Some are push in   types where the coin is pushed in a hole in the cardboard page.  Other   albums offer plastic sleeves or protective clear places for coin storage and   display.  </p>
<p><strong>album friction or slide markings </strong>-Same as friction.  </p>
  <p><strong>alloy </strong>- a mixture of two or more metals melted into one compound.    For example old Liberty Head gold coins minted prior to 1933 were made of an   alloy.  Although they were mostly gold a small amount of other metal was   added to the gold to give the resulting coins a hardness that pure gold didn't   offer.  Harder gold coins withstood wear better during circulation.    Most coins are made of some type of alloy.  Even the US nickel is made of   an alloy of nickel and other metals.  </p>
  <p><strong>Almost Uncirculated </strong>- A coin or paper money note that is very close  to being uncirculated.   Upon first glance it may appear un-circulated.  When inspected closely  it will have a slight amount of wear or friction.    Same as &quot;About Uncirculated&quot;.  Sometimes    abbreviated as &quot;AU&quot;, or &quot;A Unc&quot;.  </p>
  <p><strong>alteration </strong>-  intentional tampering of a coin usually   to make it appear more valuable.  Often deals with the coin's date or   mintmark.  However, it can involve changing the appearance (after a coin   was minted) such as when hobo nickels were made.  If the intent of altering   can be viewed as an attempt to deceive or fraud, prosecution can result.    Also, see altered date.  </p>
  <p><strong>altered date </strong>- a coin with the date manipulated or altered after the coin  was produced.  Often done to try to deceive someone.  For example, an   unscrupulous person might alter the date  of a 1944-D cent to look like a 1914-D cent, by filing off part of the first 4   to make it look like the number 1.    </p>

  <p><strong>A.N.A.</strong> - abbreviation for the &quot;American Numismatic Association&quot;.    </p>
<p><strong>ANACS </strong>- American Numismatic Association Certification Service.  This grading   and certification service certifies coins as genuine, grades, and encapsulates   them. One of the original grading services.  Has now changed   ownership and is no longer under the direction of the American Numismatic   Association (ANA).    </p>
  <p><strong>ANS </strong>- abbreviation for the &quot;American Numismatic   Society&quot;.    </p>
<p><strong>anvil die </strong>- bottom die.  A coin is struck using two dies.  One for the    obverse (front)  of the coin and another for the reverse (back).  The anvil die is the one on the bottom, which is usually  the reverse.  The term comes from when the die was placed on an anvil with the coin    blank (planchet)  on top.  The hammer die (top die) was placed on top of the coin and struck with a hammer.  See  &quot;hammer die&quot; and &quot;die&quot;.  </p>

  <p><strong>authentic</strong> (authenticate) - A coin issued by an official   government or a token issued by the original entity. Authentic indicates it is   not a replica or counterfeit coin.  Grading services such as PCGS, NGC, and   ANACS will first authenticate (determine that it is genuine) before grading the   coin.  </p>
  <p><strong>Avoirdupois </strong>- official description of the weight   system we use in the USA for weighing most items.  This unit of weight   consists of 16 ounces in a pound and 2,000 pounds in a ton.  Same weight   system used in US grocery stores to weigh produce.  This unit of weight   differs from the &quot;troy ounce&quot; weight system used to weigh precious metals.    One avoirdupois ounce does not weigh the same as a troy ounce.  Many a coin   collector has lost money by weighing silver coins on a &quot;common&quot; (avoirdupois)   scale instead of a troy ounce scale.     </p>
  <p><strong>Au </strong>- elemental (scientific) abbreviation for the   metal GOLD.  </p>

A coin can still be  un-circulated even if it has obvious nicks or bag marks. 
  <strong>bag stain </strong>- discoloration, tarnish, or toning   on the surface of a coin because of coming in contact with the cloth of a coin   bag.  Long term storage in canvas or cloth bags may cause such bag stains.

  <p><strong>barber </strong>- nick name for United States dimes, quarters,   and half dollars designed by Charles E. Barber.  Barber coins we minted   from 1892 to 1916.  Originally these coins were called Liberty Head because   they depict a &ldquo;liberty head&rdquo; design on   the front (obverse) and a eagle with shield on the reverse. Although Charles   Barber designed other coins, only the Barber Dimes, Barber Quarters, and Barber   Half dollars have acquired this nickname<em>. (Sometimes misspelled as barb<u>a</u>r.)</em> 
  </p>
  <p><strong>Barber, Charles E. </strong>- Charles E Barber was chief engraver   of the US Mint in the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Coins that he designed   often have an almost microscopic &quot;B&quot; on them, often at the base of the neck on   the portraits.  He designed various United States coins for circulation,   commemoratives, and some pattern coins such as the rare $4 Flowing Hair Stella   coin.

A small piece equal to one eighth of the dollar was called a &quot;piece of eight&quot; or a &quot;bit&quot;.    The nursery rime &quot;two bits, four bits, 6 bits, a dollar&quot; comes from this time in history.&quot;    A bit would be the equivalent of 12 1/2 cents. Example,  two bits equals two eighths or a quarter.

    <strong>Blue Book </strong>- Coin collecting price guide that lists the   wholesale prices that a US coin dealer might pay.  Has a blue cover, hence   the term blue book. Differs from the Red Book in that the  Red Book (GuideBook to US Coins) lists the approximate retail values of US   coins.
    <strong>Blue Sheet </strong>- Nickname for the  Certified Coin Dealer newsletter.  Printed on bluish paper.  The   bluesheet lists various US coins and bid/ask dealer prices for some of these   certified/graded coins.
    <strong>bodybag </strong>- identifies a coin that was returned by a   coin grading/certification in a poly bag or flip and not certified/graded   because of some problem with the coin. Most coin grading services charge to   examine a coin, even if they decide not to grade,  slab or certify the coin.    
    <strong>borderline </strong>- A coin that falls on the edge between two   grades.  Most often used as &quot;borderline uncirculated&quot;, indicating a high   grade almost uncirculated coin.  Such a coin might fall in the range of   AU55 to AU59 in the coin grading point scale..
    <strong>bourse </strong>- see &quot;show&quot;.

    <strong>broad strike </strong>- When coins are   minted a collar surrounds the coin blank and holds it in place.  This   collar keeps the metal from spreading out when the coin is struck  If a   coin blank is not properly seated in the collar, and it is struck, the result   will be an odd size or broadstruck coin.
    <strong>bronze </strong>- an alloy   (mixture) of copper, zinc, and tin.  Color usually brownish yellow.
    <strong>brown   spotting </strong>- brown or rust   colored spots appearing on the surface of a coin.  Often a form of tarnish   or an oxidation type reaction with the coin's surface or something that has   adhered to the coin's surface. Some times brownish yellow or red.

  <strong>buffalo nickel </strong>
  </p>
  <p>- old buffalo US five cent coins were   minted from 1913 to 1938.  These old nickels depicted an Indian Head design   on one side and the Buffalo or American Bison on the other.  The   buffalo-bison design was revived in the year 2005 for a one year special minting   on the US nickel again.  United States gold coins and a commemorative   silver dollar have also been made with a buffalo design. </p><br />
  <strong>buffalo round </strong>
  <p>- buffalo rounds are sometimes call buffalo or indian head silver rounds.    Minted by private mints and refineries they usually contain one ounce of silver.   Often they feature a design like that of the old Buffalo nickels with a buffalo   on one side and an Indian's head on the other.   Buffalo silver rounds usually sell for close to the value of silver bullion   they contain.</p><br />
  <strong>buffing </strong>
  <p>- a polishing of a coin sometimes with an abrasive that leaves  a finish that attempts to counterfeit mint luster.  A buffed coin often is worth less than one  that has not been cleaned.  See whizzed. </p><br />
  <strong>bullion </strong>
  <p>-term used when referring to items made of precious metal.  Particularly silver, gold, and platinum.  Often produced in the form of ingots,  bars, rounds, and coins. Bullion value of a coin would be  the &quot;value of the metal&quot; the coin contains. </p><br />

  <strong>burnished blank </strong>or burnished die<strong> </strong>
  <p>- treatment of a coin blank or die to give it a special slightly sandy or   polished look. Sometimes burnishing is done with chemicals or by special   polishing. Starting in 2006 the US Mint made Silver Eagle dollar coins (with the   W mint mark) with special burnished coin blanks.  Under magnification you   can notice a slight difference in the coin's field or background.</p><br />
  <strong>burnishing </strong>
  <p>- polishing or rubbing the surface of a   coin or coin blank to make it shiny.  Burnishing of a minted coin is often   considered detrimental and should be mentioned in any coin description. </p><br />
  <strong>bury or buried </strong>
  <p>- purchasing a coin or coins for more   than you can get for them. <em> Example</em> - A dealer might be buried in   bullion gold coins when he purchased them when spot gold was much higher than it is   now, and he can no longer sell them at a profit because gold prices have come   down. </p><br />
  <strong>business strike </strong>

  <p>- portrait on a coin, usually displaying the head, or head and  shoulders. </p><br />
  <strong>buyer fee or buyers fee </strong>
  <p>- a fee imposed on the buyer in a   coin or stamp auction.  Usually calculated as a percentage above the   winning bid price.  Example, a bidder bids $200 for a coin and wins the   auction.  Because the auction imposes a buyers fee of 5% the bidder will   have to pay $210 for the coin ($200 for the bid price Plus 5% or $10 buyers   fee).  Some auctions don't have buyer fees.  The auction company   should disclose all such fees prior to the opening bid.</p><br />

<h2 align="center"> &quot; C &quot;</h2>

  <strong>cabinet </strong>
  <p>
  <p>-  a coin storage unit, often made of   wood.  Was used by some coin collectors prior to the modern era to store   coins and coin collections.  Most often the cabinets consisted of several   thin drawers or movable shelves.  Each drawer would have square shaped   units in them, sometimes lined with felt or a soft material.  The collector   could slide out the drawer to examine and display the coins located in that   drawer.  In today's modern era of collecting, coin collectors have many   more choices for displaying and protecting their collections.  </p><br />
  </p><br />
  <strong>cast coin </strong>
  <p>
  <p>-  a coin that was made by pouring melted metal into  a mold or cast.  Not made by striking a die against a blank like most coins.  Casting was a common process used to try to counterfeit coins. </p><br />
  </p><br />
  <strong>cabinet friction </strong>
  <p>
  <p>- rubbing or wear on the highest   points of a coin surface.  In the days of wooden coin cabinets as coin   drawers were opened and moved the coins inside would often slide around, thereby   gradually rubbing against the drawer bottom.  This friction would cause   wear on the highest points of the coin.  This term is still used today to   indicate a coin that has a touch of wear on the highest points, such as an About   Uncirculated (AU) coin. </p><br />
  </p><br />
  <strong>cameo (deep cameo, ultra cameo, or  cam) </strong>
  <p>
  <p>- usually refers to the looks of a   proof coin, where the background design has a mirror like look and the raised   design has a frosted look to it.  This contrast gives the resulting proof   coin a cameo type affect.  Deep cameo and ultra cameo describe the same   cameo affect and imply that the cameo look is very pronounced and easily   observed.  This cameo affect is the norm for modern day proof coins,   however it is rarely found on coins made for general circulation and is less   common on coins minted prior to the mid-1960's.  Attractive early cameo   coins often sell for substantial premiums over non-cameo's of the same date and   mint mark. </p><br />
  </p><br />
  <strong>carbon spotting or carbon spots</strong>
  <p>
  <p> - Dark spots, usually black or brown, found on the surface of a coin.  They   can be of various sizes and shapes. These carbon colored spots are caused by oxidation   on the coin's surface and will sometimes hurt the coin's value.</p><br />
  </p><br />
  <strong>Carson City Mint</strong>
  <p>
  <p> - A United States government branch mint found at Carson City Nevada.    Minted primarily silver coins from 1870 to the early 1890's.  Carson City   minted coins are easily identified by a &quot;CC&quot;   mint mark. This mint was established primarily to use the vast amounts of   silver being mined in that area of the USA.</p><br />
  </p><br />
  <strong>cartwheel or cart wheel</strong>
  <p>
 - Nickname for a US Silver Dollar or large silver dollar like coin.  This   term is sometimes used to describe the luster effect on some brilliant   uncirculated coins, where the light reflects off the surface of the coin pattern   similar to the spokes of a wagon wheel. 
  </p><br />
  <strong>cent</strong>
 - one hundredth of a dollar on standard currency.  Called a centime, centabo,
       centimes, or penny in some countries.
  <strong>centered or centering</strong>
  <p>- describes the position of the coin design in relation to the coin blank (planchet)A   well centered coin is one that is struck right in the middle of the coin blank   and shows a rim that is the same width all around the coin. </p><br />
  <strong>certified or certified coin</strong>
  <p>- A coin certified as genuine by a coin certification service as genuine.   Often a certified coin will be graded by a coin grading service such as  PCGS,  NGC,  ANACS. Often a certified coin is accompanied by a photograph   certificate or sealed in a special plastic slab. Also see &quot;slabbed&quot;.</p><br />
  <strong>Charlotte Mint</strong>
  <p>- A United States government  branch mint in Charlotte North Carolina.  Used to mint primarily gold   coins prior to the Civil War.  The mint stopped coin production in 1861.   Charlotte Mint coins are identified by the  &quot;C&quot; mint mark.</p><br />
  <strong>cherry picker (cherrypicker)</strong>
  <p>- a collector or dealer who finds hidden scarce coins by looking through   collections or dealer&rsquo;s inventory.</p><br />
  <strong>chop marks </strong>
  <p>
  <p>-  oriental marks or characters stamped into previously  made coins.  Often found on silver trade dollars and other precious metal coins.  When coins were  used for trading purposes a oriental assayer would test a piece of the coin for purity.  If  it met his approval he would stamp his mark into the coin indicating to others it was pure  and accurate weight.  Today some collectors specialize in &quot;Chop marked&quot; coins.  However, for  many coins the chop marks may hurt the value. </p><br />
  </p><br />
  <strong>chrometophobia</strong>
  <p>- a fear of money phobia.  Some types of  money phobias like   chrometophobia have to do with using money and making decisions with it.    Other types of phobias such as Fear of Germs, Verminophobia, misophobia,   mysophobia, Spermatophobia, and Germ Fear might be the real cause of someone   being afraid of coins or paper money.</p><br />
  <strong>chrematophobia</strong>
           - another spelling for the   &quot;fear of money&quot; type of phobia
  <strong>circulation </strong>

  <strong>clad </strong>
  <p>- Clad coinage is a term used to describe coins that have a core  of one type of metal and an outer layer of another metal or metals.  Most U.S. dimes, quarters,  and half dollars since 1965 have been clad.  Clad differs from a plated coin in that  the clad blank (or planchlet) is treated to seal the layers of metal together.   Also called sandwich or hamburger coins.</p><br />
  <strong>clad coin </strong>
  <p>- Coins that have a core (center layer) and outer    layer made of different metals.    </p><br />

  <p>- The physical state of a coin or medal.  Usually indicating the amount  of wear.</p><br />
  <strong>contact mark </strong>
  <p>- a mark or marks on a coin that happened from coming  in contact with another coin or object.  Usually contact marks are small.  Often this term  is used to indicate marks on a coin that are not as obvious as bag marks.   However, sometimes  it is used to mean the same thing.   See &quot;abrasions&quot;, &quot;bag mark&quot;,  or &quot;gouges&quot;. </p><br />
  <strong>copper nickel </strong>
  <p>- A metal alloy of 88% copper and 12% nickel. This alloy  was used for US Flying Eagle and Indian cents from 1856 to the middle of  1864.  The alloy caused these small cents to have a pale copper color.  Back then people called  these cents &quot;white cents&quot; because of their pale color.  A few other countries have used some copper nickel  alloys of various percentages in their coin production.

  <strong>copy </strong>
  <p>- refers to a reproduction of a coin or paper note.  Some copies may  be illegal.  Current government regulations require reproductions of US coins and paper money  to be much larger or smaller than the original.

Advice:  Don't get caught  making a copy of something without finding out exactly what is legal. </p><br />
  <strong>corrosion </strong>
  <p>- chemical reaction on the surface of a coin.    Corrosion can result from a coin coming in contact with other things (chemicals) including  chemicals in the air.  This can come about because of things coming in contact with the coin  years earlier.  Corrosion damages a coins surface and is usually worse in copper, nickel,  zinc, and silver coins.  Some experts think that toning on the surface of a coin  may help slow down this harmful process.  Also see &quot;toning&quot;. </p><br />

  <strong>cupro-nickel </strong>
  <p>-  a mixture of copper, nickel, and possibly other metals.   Today this term is most often used to refer to the current coins made by   fusing layers of copper  and nickel or combination alloy mixtures,  resulting in a &quot;sandwich&quot;   type of coin.   The current US dimes and Quarters are examples.    Technically the copper nickel cents, three cent nickels, and regular   nickels are cupro-nickel.  See  &quot;copper nickel&quot;. </p><br />

  <strong>die clash </strong>
  <p>- damage to a coin die that occurs when the top  and bottom dies collide without a coin in the press.  The dies will may hit each other  with such force that they damage each other leaving a trace of the impression on one  or both dies.  Resulting coins produced may exhibit &quot;clash marks&quot;.  Clash marks will  show some of the reverse design on the obverse side of the coin, some of the obverse  design on the reverse, or both. </p><br />
  <strong>die defect</strong>
  <p>- damage or defect of a coin die.  The coins  produced by that die will exhibit the same defects. </p><br />

  <strong>double eagle </strong>
  <p>- used to describe a twenty dollar gold piece,   the likes of those made between 1850 and 1932. Called a double eagle because the   gold content was twice that of an &quot;eagle&quot; $10 gold piece. Double Eagle gold   pieces contain &quot;almost&quot; an ounce of gold</p><br />
  <strong>double edge lettering </strong>
  <p>-   describes and error found on some US Presidential dollar coins.  The date,   motto, and mintmark are impressed into the coin edges of presidential dollar   after the coins are minted by running them through an edge lettering machine.    When run through the edge lettering machine twice some of the edge letters will   be doubled.  Plain edge presidential $ coins errors can also occur if a   coin does not go through this last (edge-lettering) step during the production   process.  Two types of Presidential double edge lettered errors exist, overlapped errors and inverted errors.</p><br />

  <strong>Eisenhower dollar</strong>
  <p>- United States dollar made from 1971 to 1978.  Sometimes called &quot;Ike&quot;   dollars because of the portrait of President/General Dwight D Eisenhower.    Ike dollars did not see a lot of use in commerce, partially because of there   large silver dollar size.  Although made of clad (nickel and copper), there   were some special versions made of 40% silver sold by the mint to collectors.  </p><br />

  </p><br />
  <strong>error  coin</strong>
  <p>- a coin that has some type of production defect on it.    The difference between a coin error and a  coin variety is that an error is considered a &quot;mistake&quot; that escaped the   quality control of the US mint inspectors.  Modern production procedures attempt to keep error coins from being released. </p><br />
  US Presidential dollar errors have been found with plain edge errors and   double edge lettering.  Double edge lettering exists as overlapped edge lettered errors and inverted edge lettered errors.

  <strong>face value </strong>
  <p>- the exchange value for which a coin is   intended to be spent or exchanged. Example:  A US quarter's face value, or   spendable value, is   25 cents.  Note that if a coin is silver (or a rare date) the collector value or   silver content may be worth more than the face value.  Face Value is Not its collector or precious metal  value. It is a coin's spendable value.</p><br />
  <strong>fair </strong>
  <p>-  A very heavily worn coin.   Date may only be partially visible.  One of the lowest grades of a coin, F-2. </p><br />
  <strong>fiat money</strong>

  <p>- the background surface of a coin not used for the design or inscription.    Often the field is flat and may not have any design to it. </p><br />
  <strong>fine </strong>
  <p>- A medium grade coin.  It corresponds to F-12 and F-15 of  the current accepted grading standards.  A Fine coin will have some detail present in the recessed areas.    However, it is not sharp and there are some details still missing.</p><br />
  <strong>fine gold  </strong>
  <p>- the purity of a gold coin or metal.   A   .999 fine gold coin is about as pure a gold coin as you can get.  .999 fine   gold means the item is 99.9% pure solid gold.  .999 fine silver would be   99.9% pure silver.  Most US silver coins minted up through 1964 were .90   fine, or 90% pure silver.</p><br />
  <strong>fineness  </strong>
  <p>- the purity of a coin, medal, or precious metal item.  Uses a scale of 0 to   1.000.  Examples:  A silver coin with fineness of .999 would be as pure as a   coin can be.  A silver coin with fineness of .500 would be made of 50% silver.    Most 1964 and earlier US silver coins were .900 fine, or 90% pure silver.</p><br />

  <strong>floral edge</strong>
  <p>- design on   the edge of a coin that looks like flowers or tulip bulbs laid on their side in   a row.  Found on some older coins like the Pillar dollars.  Edge   designs were more common on gold and silver coins years ago.  Having a   design on a coin's edge prevented unscrupulous people from shaving off some of   the silver or gold.  Any filing of the edge would be noticable, because the   edge lettering would be missing.</p><br />
  <strong>Franklin Half dollar</strong>
  <p>- Franklin Half dollars are sometimes called Liberty Bell halves because of   the Liberty bell design on the reverse.  The United States government made   the Benjamin Franklin Half dollar from 1948 to 1963. Large numbers of them were melted during the big silver   meltdowns of the late 1900's.    </p><br />
  &nbsp;
  <strong>friction </strong>
  <p>- A frontiersman might rub two sticks together and the  result is a fire.   The rubbing of a coin can result in a wear on its surface.

  <p>- Gold Eagle coins were first minted by the   United States government in 1986.  Intended to compete with the world   bullion gold coins such as the Canadian Maple Leaf and South African Krugerrand,   the gold eagles have become very popular gold bullion coins, with millions   having been made by the US mint since their 1986 introduction.  Today   several sizes of gold eagle coins are made:  1/10 oz, fourth ounce, half   oz. and one ounce coins.  Sometimes these coins are called &quot;American   Eagles&quot;, GE, or AGE.</p><br />
  <strong> gold price </strong>
  <p>- the price   of gold per troy ounce or killogram.</p><br />
  <strong>goloid </strong>
  <p>- an alloy of silver, gold and copper.    Goloid was a metal coin alloy proposed and patented by Dr. William Wheeler   Hubbell in 1877.  A goloid coin would contain about 3-4% gold, 9% copper   and mostly silver.  Dr. Wheeler proposed an international system of using   goloid in coinage. This international push for &quot;metric dollars&quot; failed to result   in world community acceptance. A number of prototype (pattern) US coins were   made of goloid between 1878 to 1880, but none were ever released into   circulation.  <br />
    Goloid was not accepted as circulating coinage metal because it was difficult to   distinguished from normal 90% silver coins.    The fear was that counterfeiters might use a silver-copper alloy to make fake   copies of any coins produced (without the 3-4% gold in them). </p><br />
  <strong>gouges </strong>
  <p>- heavy marks on a coin where the metal was gouged out from coming  in contact with something.  Typically worse than &quot;contact marks&quot; or &quot;bag marks&quot;. </p><br />
  <strong>grade </strong>
  <p>- a rating or clarification that indicates how much wear a circulated coin  has.  Grades can also indicate the degree of perfection for uncirculated coins.  Two popular  grading guides are Photograde and the ANA Grading Guide.  Both use a   number scale system from 1 to 70,   measuring coins from a low grade such as About Good -3 to the highest grade of Mint State Uncirculated-70. </p><br />
  <strong> grading standards </strong>
  <p>- a set of criteria indicating how much wear a coin shows. </p><br />
  
  <strong>gram</strong>
  <p>- weight.  Metric system of measuring weights.  Approximately 31.1   grams are in one troy ounce.   Abbreviation = gm.</p><br />
  <strong>granular</strong>
  <p>- used to describe a porous appearance or surface, often visible under   slight magnification. A granular appearance can be the result of many factors,   such as oxidation of the metal, exposure to moisture, or chemicals intentionally   or accidentally exposed to the coin.</p><br />
  <strong>greeddobo </strong> (greed-dough-bough)

  <strong>hamburger coin </strong>
  <p>- another name for a clad coin. Clad coins were   first minted in the USA in 1965. Clad coins have a center-layer that is a   different colored material than top and bottom layers.  Thus originates the   idea that the center core is like the meat in a hamburger.  Hamburger coins   are also called sandwich coins.</p><br />
  <strong>hammer die </strong>
  <p>- top die.  The hammer die is the top die that is placed on top of the coin   blank and struck.   Years ago this was done with a hammer.  See  &quot;anvil die&quot; and &quot;die&quot;.</p><br />
  <strong>hammered coins </strong>
  <p>- coins minted by hammering the   dies together.  A coin blank was inserted between two coin dies and struck   with a hammer-like tool.  This minting method (hammering coins) was in use   for centuries. During the 1700's the coin press replaced hammering and became   the preferred method for minting coins. </p><br />
  <strong>head </strong>
  <p>- the obverse or front of most coins.  Usually with a portrait of someone  but not always. </p><br />
  
  <strong>heavy gold electroplate </strong>
  <p>- heavy gold   electroplate is in reality a very thin layer of gold placed on the surface of a   coin or object by means of electroplating. Often gives the appearance of solid   gold. Although heavier than typical electroplating, heavy gold electroplate is   still very thin, often amounting to much less than 1% gold on the total object. </p><br />
  Sometimes abbreviated as HGE.        <u>Buyer warning:</u>  Although a typical electroplated item may have   an inscription like 24 Kt GOLD HGE, it means that only the thin layer on the   outside of the object is 24 Kt gold.  Some sellers intend for the buyer to   think they are buying solid gold, when they are not.

  <strong>incuse </strong>- the part of a coin's design that is pressed into the surface.  Opposite of relief.   Example: the $2 1/2 and $5 Indian US gold coins    are incuse design.  Rather than the design  being raised up off of the surface of the coin, it is pressed into the metal. See &quot;reeded edge&quot; and   &quot;lettered edge&quot; 
  <strong>ingot </strong>- see &quot;bars&quot; 
  <strong>Ike dollar</strong>-  Eisenhower dollar
  <strong>inscription </strong>- the words stamped (or written) on a coin. 
  <strong>intrinsic value</strong>- the value of the precious metal that a coin is made of. Often called   &quot;bullion value&quot;.  Not to be confused with &quot;face value&quot;.
  <strong>inverted date </strong>-   normally a coin error where the date is punched into a coin die backwards or   upside down.  The result is that all coins minted from that coin die will   show the date mistake. Often the mint employee will try to cover up their   mistake by re-punching the same die correctly.  The result may be called an   overdate error, where one numeral is stamped over another. Generations ago, US   mint employees used logo punches to   punch the numerals into a coin die.  This also explains why the gap between   numerals varies on older coins. 
  <strong>inverted edge lettering error </strong>-   Presidential US dollar coins have edge lettering indicating the date, mint mark,   and mottos.  The edge lettering is added by submitting the coins through an   edge lettering machine after the face and back of the coins are struck. When a   coin is  accidentally run through the edge lettering machine twice, the   letters on the edge will appear doubled.  &quot;Inverted&quot; edge lettering means   that the second set of edge letters are &quot;upside down&quot; when compared with the   first set of edge letters.  
  <strong>investment grade </strong>-   used to indicate a high grade of coin that might make a good investment. <strong>iron dollar </strong>-   nickname for a US silver dollar.  The &quot;iron&quot; dollar terminology was   primarily used in northeastern USA.  This uncomplimentary phrase was used   by people who disliked carrying silver dollars due to their heavy weight.

  <strong>junk silver </strong>- silver coins of circulated quality.  Often used to describe bags  of coins or common United States silver coins that were pulled out of circulation when silver   coinage was disappearing.  Does not mean the coins are damaged.  Junk silver rolls or bags usually will not contain scarce dates,  low mintages, or high quality coins. 
  Typical US dimes, quarters, and half dollar coins minted in 1964 (and before)   may be considered junk silver, if they have some circulation wear and are not a   scarcer date.  Junk silver coins are offten sold at reasonable prices for a small premium over silver content.

  <strong>legal tender </strong>- coins, paper money, or other currency issued by a government and  used as money.   The legal tender value of a coin is the value placed on it by the government.  It may be different than the intrinsic value (bullion value) or collector value.

  <strong>legend </strong>- the main lettering on a coin or paper money. For instance the phrase &quot;United  States of America&quot;. 
</dl>

  <strong>lettered edge </strong>- The edge of a coin that has lettering on the outside  of it.  Usually it is raised, but sometimes incused.  (Also see edge lettering.) Most coins today have a plain edge or  &quot;reeded&quot; edge.  Having something inscribed or a design on the edge of a coin  was prevalant when coins were made of precious metal.  Supposedly it made it easier to detect  when a coin that had some of its precious metal shaved off the edge.  You'll find most all of the  older gold and silver US coins will have either lettered or reeded edges.  Bust half dollars of the early 1800's have lettered edges. Modern day  Presidential Dollar coins also have lettering on the edges. Today's dime and quarter are examples of a reeded edge.  See reeded edge and plain edge.

  <strong>matte proof </strong>
  <p>- matte proof coins are special proofs that have a grainy &quot;sandblasted&quot; look on the surface.    Matte proof coins were sometimes made in the early part of the 1900's.  Normal proof coins have  a mirror like brilliant surface.</p><br />
  <strong>medal </strong>
  <p>- an object made of metal that resembles a coin.  Often medals are made or given   to recognize a person, place, or occasion.  Medals have no stated value and are not intended to  circulate as money.  Sometimes a medal may have intrinsic value

  <strong>mint </strong>
  <p>- place where coins are produced (manufactured).  The U.S. Mint produces most coins  for the U.S. government in Philadelphia and Denver.  Mint facilities in San    Francisco and West Point are used to   produce some of the Proof and commemorative coins.   Normally mints produce   coins under government authority.  Example - Perth Mint produces coins for the   country of Australia.  However, private mints may also produce medals and   coins for small independent countries which can not afford their own coin   minting facilities.</p><br />
  <strong>mint luster </strong>
  <p>- a frosty, satiny, unique shine found on uncirculated   and high grade coins.  Mint luster gradually disappears as a coin receives   wear and sometimes when toning or tarnishing takes place. </p><br />
  <strong>mint mark </strong>
  <p>- a small letter on a coin that identifies which of the U.S. Mints  the coin was produced at.   Some other coins will also use mint marks to   distinguish the specific minting facilities where their coins are struck. A US   coin with no mint mark means it was usually minted at the Philadelphia US mint.  </p><br />
  <strong><a name="mintproofingpiece" id="mintproofingpiece"></a>mint proofing piece </strong>
  <p>- ingots of high purity gold used by   the mint to mix with and melt together with gold that was less than 90% pure.    The purpose of melting it with less than pure gold was to bring up the gold   content to .900 fine, in order for the gold to be made into coins.  Mint   proofing pieces were also used in making batches of silver bullion a higher   purity.  In the 19th century the US government mints served as places where   gold and silver could be exchanged for paper money and coins.  Often the   mint did their own refining and production of coin blanks.  Because some   bullion was less than pure when exchanged the mint had to mix batches along with   mint proofing pieces to get the proper purity before producing coins out of the   metals.  Very few of these original mint proofing pieces have ever reached   the collector market. Sometimes also called a &quot;proofing piece&quot;.  See   related terms &quot;proof   gold&quot; and &quot;proof   silver&quot;.  Thanks to   Numismatic News coin magazine for some of this information.</p><br />
  <strong>mint set </strong>
  <p>- a complete set of coins produced by a particular mint (contains one of each denomination).  Mint sets          usually contain &quot;uncirculated&quot; non-proof coins.  Click here for US mint set         production numbers.  During the years 1965, 1966 and 1967 the US   government minted &quot;Special   Mint Sets&quot; of coins to sell to collectors.</p><br />

  <strong>morgan coin </strong>
  <p>- this term was used to identify &quot;Barber&quot;   dimes, quarters and half dollars minted in the late 1800's and early 1900's.   Although designed by Charles E Barber these Liberty Head silver coins were not   designed by Morgan.  (Morgan designed the silver dollar.)  Because   they circulated at the same time as the Morgan Dollar and had some similarity in   features to the Morgan dollar, people often incorrectly called them &quot;morgans&quot;.   By the mid-1900's this term was no longer in use. </p><br />
  <strong>motto </strong>
  <p>- a saying, phrase, or principle sometimes found on a coin.  Example:  &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, and &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot;-meaning:  Out of many, are one </p><br />

  <strong>off center</strong> , or<strong> off-center</strong>
  <p>- describes the way a coin was struck by the printing dies.  If the coin was  not placed properly and the dies strike it off center then parts of the design will be  missing from the coin.  Sometimes an off-center coin will have part of the blank    planchlet showing and part of the coin design showing. </p><br />
  <strong>original roll </strong>
  <p>- a group of coins that were wrapped in paper wrappers  at the time of their production.  In early days coins were shipped to banks in cloth bags or  kegs.  Sometimes later they were shipped in rolls.   Silver coins stored in rolls will often  have toning on and near the edges but not in the center.   Some coins stored in rolls  will have fewer marks than those stored or transported in bags or kegs.  The number of coins  in a roll may vary by denomination and time of issuance.  Typically there are 50 cents in a roll,  40 nickels, 50 dimes, 40 quarters, 20 halves, 20 silver and Eisenhower dollars, and sometimes   25 SBA or Sacajewea dollars. </p><br />

  <strong>over strike</strong> or <strong> overstrike </strong>
  <p>- a coin that instead of being struck on a blank planchlet was accidentally  struck on a previously struck coin. The result is the coin design pressed into   the blank coin planchet twice. In rare occurrences an overstrike can be one type   of coin struck over another type of coin.  For example, a cent design   struck on the top of a dime.  This type of coin error is often somewhat   scarce or rare. </p><br />

  <strong><a name="proof-definition" id="proof-definition"></a>proof </strong>
  <p>- a coin produced from polished dies and/or    planchlets.  Most often each proof coin is  struck twice/or more which gives the coin a very sharp degree of detail and mirror like surface.   Proof coins  are usually made for numismatic purposes, presentations, or souvenirs.  Proofs are usually not made to circulated  in commerce.  Mishandling can lower the value and grade of a proof coin.  Proofs are sold by the mint  during their year of production at a premium to cover their special manufacturing costs. Sometimes sold  only in sets. </p><br />
  <em>                                         Suggested reading -  </em> <em> <strong>What is a proof           coin?</strong></em>
  <strong>proof gold </strong>
  <p>- same thing as &quot;proof silver&quot; below, only made of pure gold.  Also see   &quot;mint   proofing piece&quot;.</p><br />
  <strong>proof set </strong>
  <p>- a group of the different denominations of the proof coins made for one year.   Sometimes packaged as a set by the mint.   Example: One of each proof: cent, nickel, dime, quarter, and half.       Occasionally there will be some coins that are not included in the proof   sets.   <em>For a list of US proof set mintages click               here.           To   see Proof Sets for sale please click here. </em></p><br />
  <strong>proof silver </strong>
  <p>- unlike a similar term &quot;proof silver coins&quot; which indicates that a silver   coin is in proof condition, &quot;proof silvers&quot; refer to samples of pure silver.    These are used to test and make comparisons during the coin assaying process.    By having samples of pure precious metals available mint assayers can accurately   test coins for correct purity.  Most 'proof silver' and 'proof gold' pieces   are made at the Philadelphia US mint and supplied to the other mints and   government assay offices.

  <strong>Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) </strong>
  <p>- a substance put in   plastic to add softness and clarity to the material. Over time PVC has been   found to Leach out and damage coins.  <strong>DO NOT USE Plastic holders that   contain PVC. </strong>Often found in packaging materials used to store coins, 2x2   coin holders, flips, baseball cards and photo album pages, etc. The coin   collecting hobby became much more aware of the damage that PVC can do to a coin   in the 1970's and 1980's when such coin holders became very popular. Because PVC   acts as a softener in plastics, it is usually not found in rigid or hard plastic   coin holders.   </p><br />

  <strong><a name="reeded-edge-coins" id="reeded-edge-coins"></a>reeded edge </strong>
  <p>-   The edge of a coin that has small reed like groove lines on it.  Today's US dimes and quarters are  examples of reeded edge coins.  Today's pennies and nickels have a plain edge,   not a reeded edge. See &quot;lettered edge&quot; and &quot;incused edge&quot;.    The 2007 presidential dollar coins have a lettered edge. </p><br />
  <strong><a name="coin-relief" id="coin-relief"></a>relief </strong>
  <p>- the part of the design that is raised from the   surface of the coin field (background).  Example:  Washington's face on a Washington quarter.    (The opposite of &quot;incused&quot;.)</p><br />
  <strong>repaired</strong>
  <p>- a coin or currency note that has been fixed to   look like nothing has been wrong with it. The repair being done to fix damage, a   hole or defects.  The seller's description should mention that the coin was   repaired.  Often repaired coins will bring less than a coin (of equal   grade) that has never had anything wrong with it, but sell for more than a fully   damaged coin. The key point being, that the buyer needs to know about anything   that was done to the coin in order to make a fair judgment when making a   purchase decision. </p><br />
  <strong>replica</strong>
  <p>- a coin copy or reproduction.  Sometimes called a copy of facsimile.    Resembles the original in design.  For a replica of a US coin or currency   to be legally sold in most countries it must meet certain governmental criteria.   One point being that it must have the word &quot;copy&quot;, &quot;replica&quot;, or &quot;facsimile&quot;   plainly visible.  Another point being that it can not be presented as being   an original.  US coins and currency replicas must also be of a certain   (government required) degree larger or smaller than the original so that there   is no confusion with the original.  Additional government laws must be met   when dealing with government issued money, certificates, and copyrighted and   trademarked items.  A replica coin is different than a counterfeit coin.</p><br />
  <strong>restrike   (re-strike)</strong>
  <p>- a coin minted from original dies, however at a later date than originally intended.    Example, confederate (civil war) restrike tokens. </p><br />
  <p>Sometimes used to mean a fake coin, as in &quot;the gold coin in this ring is a   jeweler's restrike&quot;. </p><br />
  <strong>reverse </strong>
  <p>- the back side of the coin. Sometimes called the &quot;tails&quot; side of the coin,   because in many years there was an eagle design with it's tail feather's   showing.  Opposite of obverse or heads side of the coin. </p><br />
  <strong>reverse  proof</strong>
  <p>- proof coins normally have a mirror like background (field) and a frosty or   regular raised design.  A reverse proof will have a mirror like raised   design and a frosty or normal appearance to the coins background. Both regular proof coins and reverse proof coins are technically &quot;proof&quot; coins.    The difference is in the areas of the coin that are frosted and mirror-like. Click here for an example.</p><br />
  <strong>riddler </strong>
  <p>- a machine used in the minting process that sorts out wrong    size/defective blanks (planchlets). </p><br />
  <strong>rim </strong>
  <p>- the raised edge of a coin created by the upsetting mill.  The idea being that if the edge  on both sides of the coin is raised like the design it will help protect the coins design from wear. </p><br />
  <strong>roll </strong>
  <p>- a group of coins in the same denomination in a paper wrapper   package by banks, dealers, or  the US Mint.   Sometimes a coin rolls are put into a plastic coin tube.     The number of coins in a roll depend on the denomination.  For US Cents there are typically 50 coins in a roll, nickels- 40, dimes-   50, quarters- 40, halves- 20, dollars- 25. </p><br />
  <strong>rounds </strong>
  <p>- coin shaped silver pieces.  Not official legal tender, however they may  be accurate in bullion weight.  Like silver bars only round shaped to look like a coin.</p><br />
   <strong>rust </strong>
  <p>- rust is a oxidizing reaction causing the surface of a metal coin to   corrode or decay.  US pennies (cents) minted during World War 2 (in 1943)   were made of zinc plated steel. Once the zinc plating wore off, the coin surface   became exposed to the air and often rusted. Other coins, such as copper and even   silver are subject to similar oxidation when exposed to air, moisture, or   environmental chemicals. </p><br />
  <strong>rust spot </strong>
  <p>- Reddish or rust color spots can appear on gold coins, as well as coins   made of other metals. Spotting can be from something on the surface of the coin   or actually from impurities in the coin's metal.  See this interesting   article explaining how brown-rust spots can appear on gold coins or gold   bars.  See brown spots.</p><br />

  <strong>Saint-Gaudens</strong>
  <p>- Augustus Saint-Gaudens was a well know artist and coin designer of    the early 1900's.  Perhaps his most famous coin design is the US $20 gold   piece last minted in 1933.  Depicting a standing &quot;Liberty walking toward   you&quot;, this US twenty dollar coin has been honored as one of the best US coin   designs from the last century. Sometimes pronounced as &quot;Saint-Gah-dens&quot; or   &quot;Sent-Go-denz&quot;. The $20 gold coin design is so well liked it is often called a   &quot;Saint-Gaudens&quot; gold coin.</p><br />
  <strong>sandwich coin</strong>
  <p>- nick name for clad coins that were first made in the US in 1965. Because these coins have a center   layer that is a different material than the top and bottom, they resemble a   sandwich. Also sometimes called a hamburger   coin.</p><br />
  <strong>seller fees</strong>
  <p>- fees imposed on the seller when auctioning coins or selling them on  consignment.  Also see  buyers fees.

  <strong>site unseen </strong>
  <p>- an offer to purchase a coin at a certain price  without seeing the item.  Although site unseen bids are common, the coin will still have  to meet the grading criteria from the bidder's perspective.   Site unseen   auction bids are sometimes used when a coin is graded/certified by a third party grading service, such  as with slabbed coins. </p><br />
  <strong><a name="slabbed-coins" id="slabbed-coins"></a>slab or slabbed </strong>
  <p>-  slang for a holder holding a coin that has been encapsulated by a coin  grading service.  Usually, the coin will graded, authenticated, and encapsulated in a   sonically sealed holder, often by a 3rd party grading service.  See PNG, NCG, ANACS, PCGS. </p><br />
  <strong>slab </strong>
  <p>- term used to identify a hard plastic    encapsulation method  that some coin grading services use to package/protect a coin.

  <strong>slider </strong>
  <p> -a term meaning the coin simulates a higher grade  than it really is.  Often a slider has been cleaned, treated, or whizzed to give the  appearance of being uncirculated.  Worth less than the coin that has not   been cleaned or treated. </p><br />
  <strong>split grade</strong>
  <p>- a different grade for a coins front (obverse) and back (reverse).    Example, a coin might be very fine condition on the obverse and extra fine on   the reverse. Spit grade coins occur often.  However, many coin dealers will   list and sell/buy such a coin at the lower of the two grades.</p><br />
  <strong>spot</strong>

  <strong>spotting or spot </strong>
<p>-   a mark or marks on a coin of a different color.   Often looking like spots of something on  the coin.  Usually, it is a form of tarnish or staining.  Spotting may have a negative effect on the value  of a coin depending on how severe it is, etc.  Most professionals will advise you not to try  to clean a spot (or spotting) off of a coin, as it may create friction or surface damage that may  hurt the coins value even more.</p>
<p><strong>spread </strong>- The difference in price between a dealer's buy price and sell price.    Example, someone might buy a coin for $30 and sell the same coin for $40.    The coin's spread would be 40-30, or $10.</p>
<p><strong>state quarters </strong>- The 50 State Quarter program was started in 1999 by the US government   mint. 5 quarters were produced each year commemorating the joining of states to   the United States of America. A specific design for each commemorated state   was used for the back (reverse) design of each quarter. George Washington's   portrait was used for the obverse (front) of each coin.  Quarters were issued in the order that states   joined the union, through the final year in 2008. In 2009 the fifty state   quarters program was replaced with quarters commemorating the US Territories and   Washington DC (District of Columbia). </p>
<p><strong>statehood quarters </strong>- same as 50 <em>&quot;State Quarters&quot;.  </em> Sometimes abbreviated as SHQ.</p>
<p><strong>striation</strong>- fine slightly raised lines on the surface   of a coin.  Often best seen with magnification and usually in the   background of the coin's design.  Most often caused by polishing the coin   die.
  </p>
<p><strong>strike </strong>- a process of stamping a design into a coin    planchet (blank). Usually metal dies with designs engraved in them are used.   If the dies are struck weakly or just average it may effect the coin's value   negatively vs. a well struck coin. Some U.S. mints were known for making weakly   stuck coins during certain years.</p>
<p> <strong>Susan B. Anthony dollar </strong>- The United States government made a silver dollar with Susan B. Anthony's   portrait in 1979 to 1981, and then again in one more year, 1999.  These   &quot;SBA&quot; dollars were short lived and saw little use in commerce.  The size is   smaller than the old silver dollars and slightly larger than a quarter.  Click here for a picture   of what they look like.</p>
<p><strong>sweating</strong>- illegal process of removing gold or silver from the surface of a coin.    This method was used during the times when precious metal coins circulated in   everyday commerce. Sweaters would treat a coin (often a gold coin) in an acid   bath to dissolve some of the surface of the coin.  Later the dissolved gold   would be removed from the solution and sold.  The coin would then be spent   and the process repeated with additional coins.  The resulting coins would   be slightly lighter in weight and often have a grainy. pitted, or rough texture. <br />

<p><strong>third party grading </strong>- third party grading services will grade and/or certify coins as genuine.    Often the coin will be encapsulated in a plastic holder (or slab) by the grading   service to protect it.  Called &quot;third party&quot; grading when the service is   independent of any dealer or collector's influence. They provide a grading   opinion based on established criteria.  Examples may include PCGS, NGC, and   ANACS.  To see some third party graded coins click here.</p>
<p> <strong>three cent piece, </strong> or three cent coin - common term used for the US coin with the  value of three cents.  Two different metals were used for these coins back in the 1800's.  Prior to 1865 the US made three cent pieces out of an alloy of mostly silver.    Hence the name &quot;three cent silver&quot;.   The public complained because the 3 cent silvers were small and thin.    By 1865 the US government changed the composition and design of the three cent coins. 
<p><strong>Three cent nickels</strong> were made of 75% copper and 25% nickel from 1865 to 1889. From the looks of  the coin you would think it was made out of pure nickel.  They   were larger and thicker than the three cent silvers and had nickel as part of   their composition.   Hence the name &quot;three cent nickel&quot;. </p>
  <p><strong>thrip</strong>- British term for the English three pence coin.    See &quot;trime&quot;. </p>
<p><strong>token </strong>
-   Something that looks like a coin, but is not legal tender issued by an official government.   For example, parking tokens, video game machine tokens, and casino tokens.  Some coin collectors shy away  from collecting tokens.  However, there are a few small groups of serious token collectors.</p>
<p><strong>toning </strong>
- Shading of color on coins.  Toning can be in many forms  from dark or brown to various shade of other colors.  It can cover the whole coin or more often  part of the coin.  Toning results when the surface of the coin comes in contact with the air   and environment it is exposed to.  Traces of material  in the metals will also play a roll in toning.  Some think toning makes a &quot;protective&quot; coating over  the surface of a coin that helps the coin resist corrosion.  Toning can be even be    artifically done  by exposing the coin to certain reactive substances.  Some &quot;naturally&quot; occurring toned coins  bring a premium in the collector market due to their unique beauty.  Others may bring  less than an un-toned coin when the toning is unattractive.   Also see &quot;corrosion&quot;.</p>
  <strong>trends</strong>- a price guide section in a coin magazine or publication that lists current   prices of coins.  Often includes a + or - sign by a coin's value, which   indicates the change from the previous price list.

<p>  <strong>two by two</strong>- nickname for a typical holder for one coin.  Measures 2 inches by 2 inches.  Often made of cardboard with a clear mylar material in the center.   Cardboard 2x2s are   not the best way to store coins for the long term.</p>

  <p><strong>type</strong>-   coins containing the same or a similar characteristic.  Often in a type collection or set the  dates do not matter.   Rather the collector is interested in obtaining one of each representative  design.  For example a collector may want one of each &quot;type&quot; of coin in US circulation today.    Such a type set would consist of a cent, nickel, dime, quarter, half, and dollar.  A collector may decide to collect one representative of each type of coin by size.  For example,   a cent type set may include a Lincoln Memorial cent, wheat back cent, indian cent, etc.  <strong>type set</strong>- collection of coins of one denomination.  For example,  a Quarter type set would consist of one of each design of quarter that the mint  has made.  (Dates and mint marks usually are not of concern.) <br />

  </p>
  <p><strong>uncirculated or un-circulated</strong>
  - a new condition coin that does not have any  sign of wear.  Sometimes also called mint or mint condition. Marks on a coin that may come from the manufacturing process do  not keep a coin from being un-circulated.  (Example, bag marks.)  Even the slightest  amount of wear or cleaning will keep a coin from grading uncirculated, even   though the coin may have not experienced the wear from everyday use in commerce.    Uncirculated coins may vary slightly due to minor differences or imperfections. </p>

<p><strong>walker </strong>- nick name for the &quot;Walking Liberty Half dollar&quot;.  </p>
<p><strong>walking liberty </strong>- a half dollar with the Walking Liberty design.  Made between 1916 and 1947.  Thought by some to be one of the US most beautiful coin designs.  The current &quot;American Silver Eagles&quot; have the same design on their obverse (front).  </p>
<p><strong>war nickel </strong>- sometimes called &quot;wartime&quot; nickels.  These Jefferson  US five cent coins were made during part of World War II.  At the time there was a concern  that metal would be needed in the war effort.  Therefore a new mixture of metals was used  in the nickel.  35% silver, 9% manganese, and 56% copper.  As of this writing they are worth more  than five cents due to their silver content.  These &quot;silver war nickels&quot;, as some call them,  will have a large mint mark above the memorial building on the reverse (back).  </p>
<p><strong>wheat back cents </strong>- United states one cent coins minted   from 1909 and 1958.  Nick named &quot;Wheat   Back Cents&quot; or &quot;wheat pennies&quot; because the reverse of these pennies shows a   design with wheat straw near the edges.  In 1959 the Wheat back Lincoln   cent was replaced with the Lincoln memorial cent.  </p>

<p><strong>whizzed </strong>- a whizzed coin has been buffed or polished to give  it the appearance of the luster found on a mint coin.  Often whizzing is done on a high grade  coin to try to sell the  coin at a higher grade than it really is.  Sometimes done by using a fine brush attachment  on a high speed drill.  Whizzing a coin may hurt the value of it rather than help it because it  actually causes wear to the surface of the coin.  See buffing.
