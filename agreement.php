<h2>Abusing My Coin Organizer</h2>

<p>My Coin Organizer and the Community work together to keep our sites and services working properly and the Community safe. Please report problems, offensive content, and policy violations to us.</p>

<p>Without limiting other remedies, we may limit, suspend or terminate our service and user accounts, prohibit access to our sites and their content, services and tools, delay or remove hosted content, and take technical and legal steps to keep users off the sites if we think that they are creating problems or possible legal liabilities, infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies (for example, and without limitation, policies related to shill bidding, conducting off-My Coin Organizer transactions, feedback manipulation, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or users who we believe are harassing our employees or other users).  Additionally, we may, in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, suspend or terminate accounts of users who may be repeat infringers of intellectual property rights of third parties. We also reserve the right to cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time, or to modify or discontinue My Coin Organizer sites, services or tools.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>You will not hold My Coin Organizer responsible for other users' content, actions or inactions, items they list or their destruction of allegedly fake items. You acknowledge that we are not a traditional auctioneer. Instead, our sites are venues to allow anyone to offer, sell, and buy just about anything coin-related, at anytime, from anywhere, in a variety of pricing formats and locations, such as stores, fixed price formats and auction-style formats. We are not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers. While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through various programs, we have no control over and do not guarantee the quality, safety or legality of items advertised, the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings, the ability of sellers to sell items, the ability of buyers to pay for items, or that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction or return an item. For certain categories, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller.</p>

<p>We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer. Further, we cannot guarantee continuous or secure access to our sites, services or tools, and operation of our sites, services or tools may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. Accordingly, to the extent legally permitted, we exclude all implied warranties, terms and conditions. We are not liable for any loss of money, goodwill or reputation, or any special, indirect or consequential damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of your use of or your inability to use our sites, services and tools.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of damages, so such disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you.</p>

<h2>Waiver and Release of Liability</h2>

<p>If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, employees, founders and co-founders) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code ยง1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." You also waive any similar Civil Codes in your State of residency.</p>

<p>If there is an unexpected outage, database crash, loss of information or any problems with our website design and operations, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, employees, founders and co-founders) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code ยง1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." You also waive any similar Civil Codes in your State of residency.</p>

<h2>Access and Interference</h2>

<p>The sites may contain exclusion robot headers. Much of the information on the sites is updated on a real-time basis and is proprietary or is licensed to My Coin Organizer by our users or third parties. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the sites for any purpose without our express hand written permission.</p>

<p>Additionally, you agree that you will not:</p>

<ul>
<li>take any action that imposes or may impose (in our sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure;</li>
<li>copy, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, or publicly display any content (except for your information) from the sites without the prior express written permission of My Coin Organizer and the appropriate third party, as applicable;</li>

<li>bypass our robot exclusion headers or other measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the sites. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Listing Conditions</h2>

<p>By listing an item on My Coin Organizer's sites, you agree to pay My Coin Organizer's fees for such, assume full responsibility for the content of the listing and item offered, and accept the following listing conditions: When you list an item on My Coin Organizer's sites, your listing will be posted on My Coin Organizer's sites and can be viewed in My My Coin Organizer.  Your listing may not be immediately searchable by keyword or category for several hours (or up to 24 hours in some circumstances), so My Coin Organizer can't guarantee exact listing durations.  Where your listing appears in search and browse results may be based on certain factors including listing format, title, bidding activity, end time, keywords, price and shipping cost, feedback, and detailed seller ratings.  You can read more about where your listings appear in search and browse results in My Coin Organizer's Help or Guide Pages.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We use your information only as described in the <a href="http://http://mycoinorganizer.com/contact.php/privacy.php">My Coin Organizer Privacy Policy</a>.

You can access and modify the information you provide us and choose not to receive certain communications by signing-in to your account. If you object to your information being transferred or used in this way please do not use our services.</p>

<h2>Indemnity</h2>

<p><b>You will indemnify and hold us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures, employees, founders or co-founders) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your breach of this Agreement, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.</b></p>
